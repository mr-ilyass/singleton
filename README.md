## Order

1- Eager 

2- Lazy

3- ThreadSafe

4- Main

## Description 
1- Eager     : Eager initialization is easy to implement but it may cause resource and CPU time wastage. 
   Use it only if cost of initializing a class is less in terms of resources or your program will always need the instance of class.

2- Lazy      : Using Static block in Eager initialization we can provide exception handling and also can control over instance.

3-ThreadSafe : By Using synchronized we can create singleton class in multi-threading environment also but it can cause slow performanc
